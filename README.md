# N-Queens Problem
Solving the problem of arranging n queens in an nxn chess board. Both A* search and Genetic Algorithm are being applied for comparison purpuses.

You can change the size of the board, as well as the max number of allowed generations and the number of individuals per generation for the GA.

Have fun tweaking the parameters and comparing both approaches!!
